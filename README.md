# Trimerge-RockBees-Hackathon-Stage2

# Awareness and development of a Rock Bees Colony Detection & Location Monitoring Application.
Rock bees (Apis dorsata) frequently build colonies in public and residential areas, 
which can pose serious safety risks to people. The lack of awareness and early 
warning systems results in accidental disturbances and dangerous bee attacks. 
RockBee Alert seeks to offer a digital solution for identifying, reporting, and 
raising awareness about rock bee colonies through mobile technology.
