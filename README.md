# Trimerge-RockBees-Hackathon-Stage2

# Awareness and development of a Rock Bees Colony Detection & Location Monitoring Application.
# 1.Problem Statement:
Rock bees (Apis dorsata) frequently build colonies in public and residential areas, 
which can pose serious safety risks to people. The lack of awareness and early 
warning systems results in accidental disturbances and dangerous bee attacks.

raising awareness about rock bee colonies through mobile technology.
